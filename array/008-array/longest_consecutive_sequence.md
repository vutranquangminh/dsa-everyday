# ðŸ§® Longest Consecutive Sequence - Solution

This is my solution to the **"Longest Consecutive Sequence"** problem, which finds the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers in an array, regardless of their original positions.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

**Title**: Longest Consecutive Sequence

**Problem Description**:  
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence that can be formed.

A **consecutive sequence** is a sequence in which each number is exactly `+1` from the previous number. Elements **do not** have to appear consecutively in the input array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.

### Example 1:
**Input**:  
`[2, 20, 4, 10, 3, 4, 5]`

**Output**:  
`4`

**Explanation**:  
The longest consecutive sequence is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Example 2:
**Input**:  
`[0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 1]`

**Output**:  
`7`

### Constraints:
- `0 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
