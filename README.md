# NeetCode Daily Practice - Road to Big Tech

This repository is dedicated to my daily algorithm practice based on the [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) roadmap.

My goal is to consistently solve problems every day until I land a software engineering internship at a big tech company in Vietnam such as **NAB**, **MoMo**, or **Grab** — the companies I'm aiming for.
