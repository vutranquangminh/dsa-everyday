# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Grind  
> _“Consistency beats intensity.” — Keep showing up, every day._

Welcome to my personal DSA journal — a daily commitment to solving algorithm problems, following the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/), and preparing for top-tier software engineering internships in Vietnam.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📚 **Master foundational DSA topics** with NeetCode's curated problem sets.
- ⚙️ **Develop coding intuition** and sharpen problem-solving techniques.
- 🔁 **Build consistency** through daily practice and review.
- 💼 **Secure a software engineering internship** at a competitive tech company (e.g., VNG, Shopee, Tiki, FPT, or a Big Tech branch in Vietnam).

## 🛣️ Roadmap (NeetCode 150)

My learning journey follows this structured path:

1. 📦 Arrays & Hashing  
2. 🪞 Two Pointers  
3. 📚 Stack  
4. 🔍 Binary Search  
5. 🪟 Sliding Window  
6. 🔗 Linked List  
7. 🌳 Trees  
8. 🔠 Tries  
9. 🧩 Backtracking  
10. 🛞 Heap / Priority Queue  
11. ✏️ Graphs  
12. 🔁 Dynamic Programming

> ✅ I track progress through each topic and revisit hard problems weekly.
