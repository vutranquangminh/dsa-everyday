# 🧠 Mastering DSA Daily 
> _“Start small. Be consistent. Master the fundamentals.”_

Welcome to my daily **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey. As a beginner in problem-solving, I'm committed to solving at least **one DSA problem every day** using **Python 3**, gradually progressing from HackerRank to LeetCode and finally consolidating knowledge via the NeetCode roadmap.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🟢 **Begin with HackerRank** to grasp DSA fundamentals through beginner-friendly problems  
- 🟡 **Level up with LeetCode** for more structured challenges across core topics  
- 🔵 **Consolidate via NeetCode 150** to develop interview-level mastery  
- 🧠 **Sharpen problem-solving skills** and build strong coding intuition  
- 💼 **Secure a software engineering internship** at top companies in Vietnam (e.g., VNG, Shopee, Tiki, FPT, or Big Tech branches)
