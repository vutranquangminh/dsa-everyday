**Title**: Valid Parentheses

**Problem Description**:  
You are given a string `s` consisting of the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'`. A string is considered **valid** if it satisfies all the following conditions:

- Open brackets are closed in the **correct order**.  
- Every **close bracket** has a corresponding **open bracket** of the same type.

Return `true` if the string is valid, otherwise return `false`.

> **Note**: An empty string is considered valid.
