# ðŸ§® Compare the Triplets - Easy

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

**Title**: Compare the Triplets

**Problem Description**:  
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories:  
- Problem clarity  
- Originality  
- Difficulty  

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet `a = (a[0], a[1], a[2])`, and for Bob's challenge it's `b = (b[0], b[1], b[2])`.

The task is to calculate their comparison points by comparing each category:

- If `a[i] > b[i]`, Alice gets 1 point.  
- If `a[i] < b[i]`, Bob gets 1 point.  
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, no points are awarded.  

Return an array of two integers: the first for Aliceâ€™s score, the second for Bobâ€™s.

## ðŸ’¡ Examples

### Example 1  
**Input**:  
```python
a = [5, 6, 7]  
b = [3, 6, 10]
```

**Output**:  
```python
[1, 1]
```

**Explanation**:  
- `a[0] > b[0]` â†’ Alice gets 1 point  
- `a[1] == b[1]` â†’ No points  
- `a[2] < b[2]` â†’ Bob gets 1 point  
So the result is `[1, 1]`.

### Example 2  
**Input**:  
```python
a = [17, 28, 30]  
b = [99, 16, 8]
```

**Output**:  
```python
[2, 1]
```

**Explanation**:  
- `a[0] < b[0]` â†’ Bob gets 1 point  
- `a[1] > b[1]` and `a[2] > b[2]` â†’ Alice gets 2 points  
So the result is `[2, 1]`.

## âœ… Recommended Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)`  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## ðŸ“Ž Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ 100`  
- `1 â‰¤ b[i] â‰¤ 100`

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

- Use a loop to compare values at each index.  
- Keep two counters: one for Alice and one for Bob.
