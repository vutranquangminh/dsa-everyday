## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to visit **Russia** on the **256th day of a given year** between **1700 and 2700**, inclusive.

Russia used:
- The **Julian calendar** from **1700 to 1917**.
- The **Gregorian calendar** from **1919 onwards**.
- In **1918**, due to the calendar shift, **February 14th** was the **32nd** day of the year.

### Leap Year Rules:

- **Julian calendar**: Leap year if year % 4 == 0  
- **Gregorian calendar**: Leap year if:
  - year % 400 == 0 **or**
  - year % 4 == 0 **and** year % 100 != 0

Your task is to determine the **date of the 256th day** of the given year in the format `dd.mm.yyyy`.
