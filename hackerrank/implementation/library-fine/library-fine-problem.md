---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Youâ€™re given two dates:
- **Returned date**: when the book was actually returned
- **Due date**: when the book *should* have been returned

Your task is to **calculate the fine** based on this fee structure:

- âœ… If the book is returned **on or before the due date** â†’ **fine = 0**
- ðŸ“… If returned **after the due day**, but **same month and year** â†’ **fine = 15 Ã— number of late days**
- ðŸ“† If returned **after the due month**, but **same year** â†’ **fine = 500 Ã— number of late months**
- ðŸ“¤ If returned **in a different year** â†’ **fixed fine = 10000**
