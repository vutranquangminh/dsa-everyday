## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

HackerLand Enterprise has a viral advertising strategy:

- On **Day 1**, the ad is shared with exactly `5` people.
- Each day:
  - Only **half** of the recipients like the ad (rounded down)
  - Each person who likes it **shares it with 3 new friends**
- This process continues for `n` days.

You are asked to find the **total number of people who have liked the ad by Day `n`**.
