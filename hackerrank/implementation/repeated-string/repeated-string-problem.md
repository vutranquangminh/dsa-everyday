# ðŸ§® Repeated String - Easy

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` made up of **lowercase English letters**, which is **repeated infinitely**.  
Given an integer `n`, determine how many times the letter **`a`** appears in the **first `n` characters** of the infinite repetition of `s`.

## ðŸ’¡ Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
aba
10
```

**Output:**
```
7
```

**Explanation:**  
The infinitely repeated string starts as `abaabaabaa...`.  
The first 10 characters are:  
```
abaabaabaa
```
Count of `a`: **7**

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
a
1000000000000
```

**Output:**
```
1000000000000
```

**Explanation:**  
The string is just `"a"`, and repeating it forms a string of all `a`s.  
So the count of `a` in the first **10Â¹Â²** characters is exactly **10Â¹Â²**.

## âœ… Recommended Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1)  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## ðŸ“Ž Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ |s| â‰¤ 100`  
- `1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10Â¹Â²`

---

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

- Count how many `a`s appear in the string `s`.
- Determine how many **full repeats** of `s` fit in the first `n` characters.
- Handle the **remaining** characters (if `n` is not a multiple of `len(s)`).
- Use arithmetic instead of building the full string.
