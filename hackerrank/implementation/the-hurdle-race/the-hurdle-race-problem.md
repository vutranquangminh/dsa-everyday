# ðŸ§® The Hurdle Race - Easy

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

A video game character is running a hurdle race. Each hurdle has a different height, and the character can jump up to a fixed maximum height `k` naturally.

However, the character can take a **magic potion** that increases their maximum jump height by **1 unit per dose**.

Your task is to calculate the **minimum number of doses** required so that the character can jump **all** the hurdles.  
If they can already jump all the hurdles, return `0`.

## ðŸ’¡ Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
5 4
1 6 3 5 2
```

**Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The character can jump `4` units naturally.
- The tallest hurdle is `6` â†’ needs `6 - 4 = 2` extra units.
âœ… So, the character needs **2 doses** of the potion.

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
5 7
2 5 4 5 2
```

**Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
- The character can jump `7` units.
- All hurdles are â‰¤ 7 â†’ no potion needed.  
âœ… So, the answer is **0**.

## ðŸ“Ž Constraints

- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100  
- 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 100  
- 1 â‰¤ height[i] â‰¤ 100

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

- Find the **maximum** hurdle height.
- Subtract the natural jump height `k`.
- If the result is negative, return `0`.
